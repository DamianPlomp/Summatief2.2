In this project a Warehouse template was made where you can add employees to you warehouse
who, if they have the right requirements, can get items for you off of the shelves etc.

This warehouse is object oriented and that's why there are 5 classes:
- Employee
- Icontainer
- Pallet
- Shelf
- Warehouse

Inside of a warehouse there are employees and shelves, and inside the shelf there are pallets.
A shelf can be added, which always contains 4 pallets, but the items on the pallets can vary which makes it
that the itemcapacity can vary aswell. For example, on a pallet there could be 20 breads, but a 100 cashew nuts.
